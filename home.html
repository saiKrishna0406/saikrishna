<h3>Pond culture is a very popular aquaculture production method with many aquatic species cultured in ponds. To have successful pond production, ponds must be properly sited and built, with careful assessment of water availability, quantity, and quality. There are two main types of pond systems: watershed and levee systems . The climate and topography of the region in which you are located will determine which type of pond system is appropriate. Areas that have enough rainfall to fill and keep ponds filled will be more suited to watershed pond systems. In an area where the main water source is groundwater, then a levee pond may be more suitable </h3>
